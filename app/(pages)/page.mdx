# Hey, I'm Niels 👋

I'm a Product Manager at <StuviaBadge /> where I [work](/work) (mostly remotely from <WeatherLocation />) to make buying and selling study materials easy and fast.

I'm a very curious and result-driven person. I like learning about how things work and more importantly: why. Whether it's at work or in private, I hold myself and others to a high standard and am capable of rallying others around a common goal.

Outside of work, I'm constantly searching for new music to listen to (even though I do own some of my favourite albums on vinyl). I also love working out (I do CrossFit), reading, and building things using the latest (web) technologies.
