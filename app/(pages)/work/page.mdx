### Stuvia

_Product Manager_

At Stuvia, I joined as the company's first product hire to help build a more user- and product-centric culture. I introduced core product practices including vision and strategy definition, an internally public roadmap, user research, and lightweight discovery processes. Together with our designer, I formalised and began gradually rolling out a new design system to modernise the platform without a risky rebuild. I also led the development of a Next.js-based marketing site and React-based component library to give non-engineering teams more autonomy. My focus has consistently been on creating high-quality user experiences that are informed by research and aligned with long-term product thinking, bringing structure and intent to how the product is shaped and evolved.

### ProRail

_Product Manager, 2016 — 2022_

I spent six years at ProRail, starting as an associate product manager before stepping into a lead role on Donna, the system that generates the Dutch railway timetable. As the first true product hire, I helped transform Donna from a feature factory into a product with clear direction and strategic intent. I introduced a long-term vision and roadmap, formalised discovery practices, and re-established foundational agile routines. I led multiple product teams, established a hiring procedure for product managers, and led a team of six of them. I also oversaw the launch of a new conflict detection module that not only significantly improved timetable quality with over 80% fewer false positives and 50% faster performance, but also laid the foundation for important technological advancements for the Dutch rail sector such as Automatic Train Operation (ATO).
