# Hey, I'm Niels Bik

I currently work as a Product Manager for [<Icon.ProRail aria-label="ProRail" className="inline w-16 align-middle" />](https://www.prorail.nl), where I'm responsible for Donna (the Dutch railroad sector's primary application for capacity allocation, its primary output being the timetable). More information about this and previous positions, as well as education history, publications, and so forth is available in my [resume](https://github.com/nielsrowinbik/resume/releases/latest/download/en.pdf).

Outside of work chances are I'm listening to music. Other than that I love to read, work out (I do CrossFit), and [code for the web](https://github.com/nielsrowinbik).

If you'd like to get in touch, [send me an e-mail](mailto:hey@nielsbik.nl) or message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nielsrowinbik).
