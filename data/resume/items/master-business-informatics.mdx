Selected the "entrepreneurial" track, which prepares for a career in building ICT products. Authored and published a paper titled "A Reference Method for User Story Requirements in Agile Systems Development" (see [publications](#publications)). Produced a thesis titled "Developing a model-driven socio-environmental auditing tool", which formed the basis for a publication by my thesis supervisor, which I in turn co-authored.
