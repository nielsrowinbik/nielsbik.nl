-   Matured the Delivery process for Donna (the Dutch railroad sector's primary application for capacity planning and allocation), resulting in a reduction in service interruptions every release (the legacy product is on a quarterly release cycle).
-   Frontlined various initiatives to greatly improve the accuracy of the product's conflict detection, reducing the amount of false positives by 80%.
-   Responsible for setting product vision and strategy for for the first time since work on the product started and introducing the necessary processes around (re-)evaluating and applying them. This included getting stakeholder buy-in for a complete overhaul of the legacy product.
-   Helped hire and form a product team as a result of scaling up from two Product Managers to nine.
-   Developed and implemented a continuous Discovery process based around desired outcomes, including a structured approach to identifying and validating problems and their solutions, thus shifting the focus from output (building feature requests) to delivering actual business value. This is an ongoing process (cultural change) that allows our (relatively young) product team to operate more freely.
